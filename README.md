1. First install all dependancies.
2. To run this chatbot, type 'main.py' in the terminal.
3. This will prompt whether you want the analysis of the dataset.
4. Type Y for yes, and N for no and enter.
5. After the analysis, if selected, or straight after if not, the chatbot will pop up in a new window.
6. Here, ask the chatbot for a gift recommendation.
7. If the chatbot has failed to do so, rerun the chatbot - it is not meant to be advanced and thus can sometimes fail.
